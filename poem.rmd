## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
  
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Some say the world will end in fire,  
Some say in ice.  
From what I've tasted of desire  
I hold with those who favor fire.  
But if it had to perish twice,  
  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun."  
  
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
In shattered halls where silence reigns,  
The cursed tread, bound by chains.  
Ruined thrones and broken crowns,  
Whisper secrets of fallen towns.  

A fading sun bleeds through the mist,  
Shadows twist where knights once kissed.  
Steel and sorrow, side by side,  
A lone soul walks, nowhere to hide.  

Rivers of flame and skies of gray,  
Guide the lost who dare not stay.  
Every step, a memory dies,  
Echoes of kingdoms’ last cries.  

Yet through the ash, a faint light gleams,  
A spark of hope in endless dreams.  
Forge your path, defy the night,  
Tarnished hearts may still find light.
